  abstract = {Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the western world. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, overall survival of patients remains poor. Scientific advances in recent years have enhanced our understanding of the biology of cancer. Human protein tyrosine kinases ({PTKs}) play a central role in human carcinogenesis and have emerged as the promising new targets. Several approaches to inhibit tyrosine kinase have been developed. These agents have shown impressive anticancer effects in preclinical studies and are emerging as promising agents in the clinic. The remarkable success of {BCR}-{ABL} tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib ({STI}571) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia has particularly stimulated intense research in this field. At least 30 inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development in cancer, and about 120 clinical trials are ongoing worldwide. In this review, we focus on the role of tyrosine kinases in cancer and the development of specific small molecule inhibitors for therapy. We also provide a critical analysis of the current data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and highlight areas for future research. Issues with regards to the design of clinical trials with such agents are also discussed. Innovative approaches are needed to fully evaluate the potential of these agents, and a concerted international effort will hopefully help to integrate these inhibitors in cancer therapy in the near future.},

  volume = {56},
  issn = {0008-5472},
  abstract = {Oncogenic activation of Abl proteins due to structural modifications can occur as a result of viral transduction or chromosomal translocation. The tyrosine protein kinase activity of oncogenic Abl proteins is known to be essential for their transforming activity. Therefore, we have attempted to identify selective inhibitors of the Abl tyrosine protein kinase. Herein we describe an inhibitor ({CGP} 57148) of the Abl and platelet-derived growth factor ({PDGF}) receptor protein-tyrosine kinases from the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine class, which is highly active in vitro and in vivo. Submicromolar concentrations of the compound inhibited both v-Abl and {PDGF} receptor autophosphorylation and {PDGF}-induced c-fos {mRNA} expression selectively in intact cells. In contrast, ligand-induced growth factor receptor autophosphorylation in response to epidermal growth factor ({EGF}), insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin showed no or weak inhibition by high concentrations of {CGP} 57148. c-fos {mRNA} expression induced by {EGF}, fibroblast growth factor, or phorbol ester was also insensitive to inhibition by {CGP} 57148. In antiproliferative assays, the compound was more than 30-100-fold more potent in inhibiting growth of v-abl-transformed {PB}-3c cells and v-sis-transformed {BALB}/c 3T3 cells relative to inhibition of {EGF}-dependent {BALB}/{MK} cells, interleukin-3-dependent {FDC}-P1 cells, and the T24 bladder carcinoma line. Furthermore, anchorage-independent growth of v-abl- and v-sis-transformed {BALB}/c 3T3 cells was inhibited potently by {CGP} 57148. When tested in vivo, {CGP} 57148 showed antitumor activity at tolerated doses against tumorigenic v-abl- and v-sis-transformed {BALB}/c 3T3 cells. In contrast, {CGP} 57148 had no antitumor activity when tested using src-transformed {BALB}/c 3T3 cells. These findings suggest that {CGP} 57148 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases that involve abnormal cellular proliferation induced by Abl protein-tyrosine kinase deregulation or {PDGF} receptor activation.},

No specific library standards have been proposed to date, however, and most research studies conducted adopt a partial view of data literacy, stressing only the components needed in any given context. The present paper aims to contribute to the advancement of data literacy with the proposal of a set of core competencies and contents that can serve as a framework of reference for its inclusion in libraries’ information literacy programs. The various definitions of data literacy are discussed, the coverage of the competencies listed in information literacy standards is described, and the competencies considered in the experiments conducted to date in education and libraries are identified. The conclusion drawn is that the model proposed can favour the development of data literacy support resources and services. Topics for further research are also specified.},

  abstract = {Previous investigators have reported discrepancies between hematologic, marrow morphologic, and cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}). In addition to disease refractoriness, rare instances of disease progression from chronic phase to blast crisis during imatinib therapy have recently been anecdotally reported. To describe the clinicopathologic features of 3 patients with {CML} who rapidly progressed from chronic phase to blast crisis while taking imatinib and to perform a review of the literature. Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analyses were performed on the 3 patients at the time of initial diagnosis, during imatinib therapy, and at blast crisis. The 3 patients were men, aged 39, 42, and 43 years. Two had been treated with hydroxyurea for 16 and 21 months before imatinib therapy, while 1 was started on a regimen of imatinib following diagnosis. Despite a hematologic response in all 3 patients, none of them achieved cytogenetic remission, and all progressed to blast crisis at 7 to 10 months of imatinib therapy. Blood findings during blast transformation were heterogeneous, including normal blood morphologic findings in 1 patient, leukocytosis with circulating blasts and basophilia in 1, and marked pancytopenia in 1. All 3 marrow specimens demonstrated moderate to marked diffuse reticulin fibrosis with more than 20\% blasts. Clonal cytogenetic evolution was evident in 2 of the 3 patients and included an extra Philadelphia chromosome in both. All 3 patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. One was alive with no evidence of disease at 14 month follow-up, while 2 had residual disease after bone marrow transplantation and died of complications at 4 and 5 months after transplantation. Blood data did not always reflect marrow status. Therefore, bone marrow follow-up is critical for monitoring of response. Our findings suggest that significant progression of marrow reticulin fibrosis during imatinib therapy can be an indicator for a return or progression of {CML} and, in some patients with {CML}, imatinib may promote cytogenetic clonal evolution, resulting in a poor response to treatment.},

Despite the remarkable results achieved with imatinib, the emergence of resistance to this drug has become a significant problem. Actually, two other second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used for resistant/intolerant patients to imatinib. With the availability of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, questions relating to adherence to prescribed therapy have become an important issue. It has been demonstrated that the effectiveness of the treatment with imatinib requires high compliance to the prescribed dose of the drug for an indefinite period of time, whereas reduced adherence to therapy has been associated with delay in achieving cytogenetic or molecular response and/or possible development of resistance. The aim of this review is to discuss the importance of adherence, and the possible tools that we have to measure it, to improve our knowledge on possible underlying causes of non-adherence and the impact of non-adherence on hospitalization risk and healthcare cost through a systematic review of the data published to date.},

A local faculty survey of data management practices and attitudes was conducted, as was a scan of related courses at peer institutions. Knowledge about data management in e-science was used to design a new course addressing data-related literacy for science students and teach them skills for managing data created as part of the scientific research process. Throughout the project, metadata proved to have a central role in how scientists operate in the e-science information environment and to be a key component of data literacy in the e-science environment.

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Currently primary scientific data, especially that dealing with biodiversity, is neither easily discoverable nor accessible. Amongst several impediments, one is a lack of professional recognition of scientific data publishing efforts. A possible solution is establishment of a 'Data Publishing Framework' which would encourage and recognise investments and efforts by institutions and individuals towards management, and publishing of primary scientific data potentially on a par with recognitions received for scholarly publications. {DISCUSSION}: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of primary biodiversity data publishing, and conceptualises a 'Data Publishing Framework' that would help incentivise efforts and investments by institutions and individuals in facilitating free and open access to biodiversity data. It further postulates the institutionalisation of a 'Data Usage Index ({DUI})', that would attribute due recognition to multiple players in the data collection/creation, management and publishing cycle. {CONCLUSION}: We believe that institutionalisation of such a 'Data Publishing Framework' that offers socio-cultural, legal, technical, economic and policy environment conducive for data publishing will facilitate expedited discovery and mobilisation of an exponential increase in quantity of 'fit-for-use' primary biodiversity data, much of which is currently invisible.},

  abstract = {One of the most critical issues to be solved in regard to cancer chemotherapy is the establishment of ways to predict the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs for individual patients. To develop a prediction system based on expression of specific genes, we analyzed expression profiles of mononuclear cells from 18 chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}) patients who were treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor {STI}571. {cDNA} microarrays representing 23 040 genes identified 79 genes that were expressed differentially between responders and non-responders to {STI}571. On the basis of the expression patterns of 15 or 30 of these genes among the patients, we developed a Prediction Score system that could clearly separate the responder group from the non-responder group. Verification of this system using four additional (test) cases succeeded in predicting the response of each of those four patients to the drug. These results provide the first evidence that gene-expression profiles can predict sensitivity of {CML} cells to {STI}571, and may eventually lead to the achievement of personalized therapy for this disease.},

In June 2005, we contacted the corresponding author of every article that appeared in the last two 2004 issues of four major {APA} journals. Because their articles had been published in {APA} journals, we were certain that all of the authors had signed the {APA} Certification of Compliance With {APA} Ethical Principles, which includes the principle on sharing data for reanalysis. Unfortunately, 6 months later, after writing more than 400 e-mails--and sending some corresponding authors detailed descriptions of our study aims, approvals of our ethical committee, signed assurances not to share data with others, and even our full resumes-we ended up with a meager 38 positive reactions and the actual data sets from 64 studies (25.7\% of the total number of 249 data sets).

Experimental Design: The outcome of 261 patients with Ph-positive chronic phase {CML} post-{IFN} failure treated with imatinib was compared with 204 historical control patients treated for a similar disease status with existing therapies. A subset of 147 patients in late chronic phase {CML} and 100\% Ph-positive status treated with imatinib was compared with 95 patients in a similar disease status treated with {IFN}. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the independent prognostic effect of therapy (imatinib versus other) on survival. Results: In the first analysis involving 261 patients on imatinib plus 204 historical patients, the complete cytogenetic response rates were 62\% and 19\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). A multivariate analysis identified pretreatment peripheral blasts and thrombocytosis to be independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Imatinib therapy (versus others) was a significant independent favorable prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio, 0.17; P {\textless} 0.0001). In the second analysis involving the subset of 147 patients receiving imatinib plus 95 historical patients treated with {IFN} regimens, the complete cytogenetic response rates were 41\% and 7\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). A multivariate analysis selected pretreatment anemia and peripheral blasts to be significant independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Imatinib therapy (versus {IFN}) was an independent favorable prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio, 0.20; P {\textless} 0.0001). Three-month and 6-month landmark analyses showed that patients in all cytogenetic response categories (major, minor, and none) after imatinib therapy had survival outcomes better than the historical control population. Within each cytogenetic response category, survival was also better with imatinib than with other therapies. Conclusions: This analysis provides evidence for a survival advantage with imatinib versus other therapies in chronic-phase {CML} post-{IFN} failure, and for a survival advantage with imatinib versus {IFN} in late chronic-phase {CML}.},

Serial molecular studies demonstrate decreases in {BCR}-{ABL} transcripts over time. Analyses of event-free survival ({EFS}) and time to progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis ({AP}/{BC}) at 7 years were based on molecular responses using the international scale ({IS}) at 6-, 12-, and 18-month landmarks.

Conversely, patients who achieved major molecular response [{MMR}: {BCR}-{ABL} ({IS}) ≤ 0.1\%] by 18 months enjoyed remarkably durable responses, with no progression to {AP}/{BC} and 95\% {EFS} at 7 years. The probability of loss of complete cytogenetic response by 7 years was only 3\% for patients in {MMR} at 18 months versus 26\% for patients with complete cytogenetic response but not {MMR} (P {\textless} .001).

Oral imatinib was administered daily at dose levels ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m(2). Plasma pharmacokinetic studies were performed on days 1 and 8 of course 1. There were 31 children who received 479 courses of imatinib. The most common toxicities encountered, which occurred in less than 5\% of courses, were grade 1 or 2 nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, and reversible increases in serum transaminases. One patient at the 440-mg/m(2) dose level had dose-limiting weight gain. There were no other first-course dose-limiting toxicities. A maximum tolerated dosage was not defined. Among 12 chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}) patients evaluable for cytogenetic response, 10 had a complete response and 1 had a partial response. Among 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia ({ALL}) patients evaluable for morphologic response, 7 achieved an M1 and 1 achieved an M2 bone marrow. We observed marked interpatient variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters. In conclusion, we found that daily oral imatinib is well tolerated in children at doses ranging from 260 to 570 mg/m(2). Doses of 260 and 340 mg/m(2) provide systemic exposures similar to those of adults who are treated with daily doses of 400 and 600 mg, respectively.},

However, almost all {CML} colonies that grow in the presence of 1.0 micromol/L {CGP}57148B are {BCR}-{ABL}-positive, which may reflect the fact that residual normal clonogenic myeloid precursors are infrequent in most patients with {CML}. We also studied the effects of {CGP}57148B on hematopoietic cell lines. Proliferation was suppressed in most of the {BCR}-{ABL}-positive lines; all five {BCR}-{ABL}-negative lines were unaffected. We conclude that this new agent may have significant therapeutic applications.},

As it is likely that resistance to a single agent would be observed, combinations of {STI}571 with other antileukemic agents have been evaluated for activity against Bcr-Abl–positive cell lines and in colony-forming assays in vitro. The specific antileukemic agents tested included several agents currently used for the treatment of {CML}: interferon-alpha ({IFN}), hydroxyurea ({HU}), daunorubicin ({DNR}), and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). In proliferation assays that use Bcr-Abl–expressing cells lines, the combination of {STI}571 with {IFN}, {DNR}, and Ara-C showed additive or synergistic effects, whereas the combination of {STI}571 and {HU} demonstrated antagonistic effects. However, in colony-forming assays that use {CML} patient samples, all combinations showed increased antiproliferative effects as compared with {STI}571 alone. These data indicate that combinations of {STI}571 with {IFN}, {DNR}, or Ara-C may be more useful than {STI}571 alone in the treatment of {CML} and suggest consideration of clinical trials of these combinations.},

A local faculty survey of data management practices and attitudes was conducted, as was a scan of related courses at peer institutions. Knowledge about data management in e-science was used to design a new course addressing data-related literacy for science students and teach them skills for managing data created as part of the scientific research process.

  abstract = {Background Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from {NSF} and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the {NSF}-sponsored {DataNET} (including projects like {DataONE}) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

Understanding the mechanisms by which these oncogenes affect various cell types has been hampered by a paucity of experimental systems that reproduce the range of biological effects associated with them. We have developed an experimental system in which murine hematopoietic stem cell populations are infected with either v-abl or {BCR}/{ABL} retroviruses and are used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Irrespective of the form of activated abl, greater than 90\% of the animals reconstituted with such cells develop tumors. About 50\% of them develop a myeloproliferative syndrome that shares several features with the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia; the remaining animals succumb to pre-B-cell lymphomas. The myeloproliferative syndrome is characterized by large numbers of clonally derived, infected myeloid cells. This model will allow study of the mechanism by which activated abl genes affect hematopoietic precursors in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that introduction of an activated abl gene into the appropriate target cell, not the structure of the gene, is the major determinant in myeloid cell specificity.},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The incidence of neural tube defects has diminished considerably since the implementation of food fortification with folic acid ({FA}). However, the impact of excess {FA} intake, particularly during pregnancy, requires investigation. In a recent study, we reported that a diet supplemented with 20-fold higher {FA} than the recommended intake for rodents had adverse effects on embryonic mouse development at embryonic days (E)10.5 and 14.5. In this report, we examined developmental outcomes in E14.5 embryos after administering a diet supplemented with 10-fold higher {FA} than recommended to pregnant mice with and without a mild deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ({MTHFR}). {METHODS}: Pregnant mice with or without a deficiency in {MTHFR} were fed a control diet (recommended {FA} intake of 2 mg/kg diet for rodents) or an {FA}-supplemented diet ({FASD}; 10-fold higher than the recommended intake [20 mg/kg diet]). At E14.5, mice were examined for embryonic loss and growth retardation, and hearts were assessed for defects and for ventricular wall thickness. {RESULTS}: Maternal {FA} supplementation was associated with embryonic loss, embryonic delays, a higher incidence of ventricular septal defects, and thinner left and right ventricular walls, compared to mothers fed control diet. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our work suggests that even moderately high levels of {FA} supplementation may adversely affect fetal mouse development.

This paper examines an equally daunting challenge – the diversity of interdisciplinary data, notably research data, and the need to interrelate these data to understand complex systemic problems such as environmental change and its impact. We use the experience of the International Polar Year 2007–8 ({IPY}) as a case study to examine data management approaches seeking to address issues around complex interdisciplinary science. We find that, while technology is a critical factor in addressing the interdisciplinary dimension of the data intensive science, the technologies developing for exa-scale data volumes differ from those that are needed for extremely distributed and heterogeneous data. Research data will continue to be highly heterogeneous and distributed and will require technologies to be much simpler and more flexible. More importantly, there is a need for both technical and cultural adaptation. We describe a vision of discoverable, open, linked, useful, and safe collections of data, organized and curated using the best principles and practices of information and library science. This vision provides a framework for our discussion and leads us to suggest several short- and long-term strategies to facilitate a socio-technical evolution in the overall science data ecosystem.},

The c-abl protooncogene is translocated from chromosome 9 band q34 into bcr and the biochemical consequence of this molecular rearrangement is the production of an abnormal fusion protein bcr-abl p210 with enhanced protein-tyrosine kinase activity compared to the normal p145 c-abl protein. The Ph chromosome translocation is also seen in some acute lymphoblastic leukaemias with B-cell precursor phenotypes some of which have bcr rearrangement (bcr+) and some do not (bcr-). We present evidence that the Ph+, bcr- leukaemias are associated with a novel p190 abl kinase. We propose that acute lymphoblastic leukaemias that are bcr+, p210+ are probably lymphoid blast crises following a clinically silent chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukaemia arising in multipotential stem cells whereas bcr-, p190+ cases are de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemias arising in more restricted precursors.},

Adverse events requiring discontinuation were more common in the high-dose arm ({RR} 1.98, 95\% {CI} 1.20–3.26, three trials, I2 = 0\%), as were Grade {III}/{IV} neutropenia and thrombocytopenia: {RR} 1.56, 95\% {CI} 1.15–2.12 and {RR} 1.86, 95\% {CI} 1.28–2.70, respectively.There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of higher doses of imatinib as frontline treatment for {CP}-{CML}. Extended follow up is needed to evaluate if the superior {CCyR} and {MMolR} with higher doses of imatinib will translate to long-term clinical benefit. Am. J.

This study analyzed the response rate, progression-free survival ({PFS}), overall survival ({OS}), and toxicities in patients with {CML} given imatinib. Analysis included patients with {CML} who received imatinib under the {GIPAP} program at our institution from January 2002 to December 2008. Standard criteria for hematological and cytogenetic responses were used. There were 400 patients, with a median follow-up of 47 months. One hundred and seventy received prior non-imatinib therapy and 230 patients received imatinib upfront. Ninety-five percent of patients achieved complete hematological response. The cumulative best rate of major cytogenetic response was 72\%, with 53\% complete cytogenetic response and 19\% partial cytogenetic response. The estimated {PFS} and {OS} at median follow-up for the whole group was 76\% and 94\%, respectively. Differences in {PFS} and {OS} in prior non-imatinib and upfront imatinib groups were not statistically significant. However, better {PFS} and {OS} were seen in the upfront imatinib group. Imatinib was well tolerated in our study.},

Setting: A program at a health sciences library serving a large academic medical center with a strong research focus is described. Methods: The bioinformatics service program was established at the Norris Medical Library in 2005. As part of program development, the library assessed users' bioinformatics needs, acquired additional funds, established and expanded service offerings, and explored additional roles in promoting on- campus collaboration. Results: Personnel and software have increased along with the number of registered software users and use of the provided services. Conclusion: With strategic efforts and persistent advocacy within the broader university environment, library-based bioinformatics service programs can become a key part of an institution's comprehensive solution to researchers' ever-increasing bioinformatics needs.},

  abstract = {The Ph+ leukemias in children include adult type chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}) and 2-3\% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ({ALL}). These leukemias are difficult to cure even with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The Ph chromosome translocates the abl gene on chromosome 9 into the bcr gene on chromosome 22, resulting in the constitutive expression of an abl tyrosine kinase essential for malignant transformation. {STI}571 is a selective inhibitor of the abnormal abl protein tyrosine kinase, causing cell death both in vitro and in vivo. It has shown activity and a good safety profile in animal models and human adult studies. A phase 1 study was conducted in patients under the age of 21 years with either {CML} refractory to interferon alpha therapy, {CML} relapsing after stem cell transplantation, or refractory or relapsing Ph+ acute leukemia. {STI} was administered daily, continuously, with courses defined as 28 day intervals. As of November 10th 2000, 14 patients, age range 3-19 years (median 15), 9 males, have been accrued at the first 3 dose-levels (260 mg/m2, n=6; 340 mg/m2, n=4; 440 mg/m2, n= 4). Patients' diagnosis were {CML} refractory to interferon (n=5), {CML} beyond first chronic phase (n= 5) and {ALL} (n=4). Toxicities ({CTCv}2.0 {NIH} grading) for the first course are: hematological (hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils and/or leukocytes) grade 4 n=4 or grade 3 n=4 ; liver enzyme elevation grade 3 n=1; other grade 3 toxicities (17 events, non repetitive) n=4 patients. One patient experienced intracranial hemorrhage while thrombocytopenic and receiving systemic anticoagulation therapy. Patients accrued on the first 3 treatment levels received a total of 48 courses of treatment (median 3; range 2-8). Data on pharmacokinetics will be available shortly. The maximum tolerated dose has not yet been reached. Accrual of patients is being completed at the 4th dose level (570mg/m2).},

We decided to use Interferon as common first-line therapy and Imatinib and Rituximab (anti-{CD}20 monoclonal antibody), to improve the first-line therapy result, obtaining a complete molecular remission for {CML} and clinical remission with molecular minimal residual disease for {HCL}.

  abstract = {This paper presents a brief literature review and then introduces the methods, design, and construction of the Data Curation Profile, an instrument that can be used to provide detailed information on particular data forms that might be curated by an academic library. These data forms are presented in the context of the related sub-disciplinary research area, and they provide the flow of the research process from which these data are generated. The profiles also represent the needs for data curation from the perspective of the data producers, using their own language. As such, they support the exploration of data curation across different research domains in real and practical terms. With the sponsorship of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, investigators from Purdue University and the University of Illinois interviewed 19 faculty subjects to identify needs for discovery, access, preservation, and reuse of their research data. For each subject, a profile was constructed that includes information about his or her general research, data forms and stages, value of data, data ingest, intellectual property, organization and description of data, tools, interoperability, impact and prestige, data management, and preservation. Each profile also presents a specific dataset supplied by the subject to serve as a concrete example. The Data Curation Profiles are being published to a public wiki for questions and discussion, and a blank template will be disseminated with guidelines for others to create and share their own profiles. This study was conducted primarily from the viewpoint of librarians interacting with faculty researchers; however, it is expected that these findings will complement a wide variety of data curation research and practice outside of librarianship and the university environment.},

  abstract = {Chronic myelogenous leukemia ({CML}) is a clonal hematologic malignancy characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)] in greater than 90\% of cases. This translocation results in a short chromosome 22, termed the Philadelphia (Ph1 or 22q-) chromosome. Recently, the cellular oncogenes abl and sis were mapped to human chromosomes 9 and 22, respectively. Moreover, abl was shown to be translocated from chromosome 9 to 22 and sis from chromosome 22 to 9 in {CML} patients with t(9;22). These findings raised the possibility that one or both of these oncogenes is activated and directly involved in the development of the disease. We analyzed expression of the abl and sis oncogenes in leukemic cells from {CML} patients with t(9;22). We found that sis is not expressed but that abl is transcribed into an 8-kilobase {RNA}. This abl {RNA} is also present in two leukemic cell lines ({EM}2 and K562), which were derived from {CML} patients and contain the t(9;22). This 8-kilobase {RNA} is not detected in normal cells, in other human leukemias without t(9;22), or in human cell lines that lack t(9;22). The consistent presence of this abl {RNA} transcript in {CML} with t(9;22) suggests that it is a consequence of abl translocation and that it plays a role in the development of this leukemia.},

  abstract = {Chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the overproduction of granulocytes, which leads to high white blood cell counts and splenomegaly in patients. Based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, {CML} is classified into three clinical phases, often starting with a chronic phase, progressing to an accelerated phase and ultimately ending in a terminal phase called blast crisis. Blast crisis phase of {CML} is clinically similar to an acute leukemia; in particular, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-{ALL}) is a severe form of acute leukemia in blast crisis, and there is no effective therapy for it yet. {CML} is induced by the {BCR}-{ABL} oncogene, whose gene product is a {BCR}-{ABL} tyrosine kinase. Currently, inhibition of {BCR}-{ABL} kinase activity by its kinase inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a major therapeutic strategy for {CML}. However, the inability of {BCR}-{ABL} kinase inhibitors to completely kill leukemia stem cells ({LSCs}) indicates that these kinase inhibitors are unlikely to cure {CML}. In addition, drug resistance due to the development of {BCRABL} mutations occurs before and during treatment of {CML} with kinase inhibitors. A critical issue to resolve this problem is to fully understand the biology of {LSCs}, and to identify key genes that play significant roles in survival and self-renewal of {LSCs}. In this review, we will focus on {LSCs} in {CML} by summarizing and discussing available experimental results, including the original studies from our own laboratory.},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Currently primary scientific data, especially that dealing with biodiversity, is neither easily discoverable nor accessible. Amongst several impediments, one is a lack of professional recognition of scientific data publishing efforts. A possible solution is establishment of a 'Data Publishing Framework' which would encourage and recognise investments and efforts by institutions and individuals towards management, and publishing of primary scientific data potentially on a par with recognitions received for scholarly publications. {DISCUSSION}: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of primary biodiversity data publishing, and conceptualises a 'Data Publishing Framework' that would help incentivise efforts and investments by institutions and individuals in facilitating free and open access to biodiversity data. It further postulates the institutionalisation of a 'Data Usage Index ({DUI})', that would attribute due recognition to multiple players in the data collection/creation, management and publishing cycle. {CONCLUSION}: We believe that institutionalisation of such a 'Data Publishing Framework' that offers socio-cultural, legal, technical, economic and policy environment conducive for data publishing will facilitate expedited discovery and mobilisation of an exponential increase in quantity of 'fit-for-use' primary biodiversity data, much of which is currently invisible.},

This paper reports on an {NSF}-funded project at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies (2007-2009) that examined this changing environment and directed specific attention to digital data management practices. A local faculty survey of data management practices and attitudes was conducted, as was a scan of related courses at peer institutions. Knowledge about data management in e-science was used to design a new course addressing data-related literacy for science students and teach them skills for managing data created as part of the scientific research process. Throughout the project, metadata proved to have a central role in how scientists operate in the e-science information environment and to be a key component of data literacy in the e-science environment.

Administrators and teachers are expected to use combinations of data (diagnostic and standardized test data, state assessment data, and local assessment data) to close achievement gaps, address literacy, evaluate and demonstrate program effectiveness, and improve instruction. In addition, reforms aimed at establishing standards-based instruction, connecting learning tasks to real-world situations, personalizing learning, and responding to diversity require the systemic use of a wide array of data by various groups and individuals. Data warehousing technology allows schools to collect, store, and analyze data more effectively. This article discusses the three key components of effective data use--focusing essential questions that guide data analysis, data warehousing technology that supports extensive data disaggregation, and a data team and data coach that ensures that the data is available and put to use. Taken together, these components support a culture of inquiry, continuous improvement, accountability, and purposeful data-driven decision-making--cornerstones of efforts to ensure the success of all students.

  abstract = {Chronic myeloid leukemia ({CML}) was the first human malignancy to be associated with a specific genetic lesion, the Philadelphia chromosome, harboring the {BCR}-{ABL} oncogene. Since then, it has become a paradigm for the discovery of molecular mechanisms and targeted therapeutic approaches in the field of hematologic neoplasias. The past 5 years or so have been particularly fruitful in the dissection of the signal transduction pathways abnormally activated in {CML} and in the translation of this knowledge to clinical practice. In this report, we discuss the biological basis for such translation and highlight the current and potential tools for the effective treatment of {CML} patients. The first part presents a review of the basic concepts on the biology of {CML} and their application to the design of targeted therapy. The mechanisms of action of the molecular-specific drugs currently used in clinical trials are discussed, with emphasis on the description of the most promising new compounds that are enhancing the potential for effective alternative or combination chemotherapy in {CML}. In the following section, we explain how molecular monitoring of response to imatinib mesylate in patients with {CML} can be used as a guide to clinical management. In particular, we discuss the relative value of regular quantitative {RT}/{PCR} and cytogenetic analyses, how responding patients should be monitored and managed, and how to investigate patients who are refractory or become resistant to imatinib treatment. In the last part of this report, a discussion on the possibility of managing {CML} with patient-specific strategies is presented. We review the current treatment options, highlight the factors impacting on decision making, discuss the range of possibilities for future therapeutic strategies and propose a systematic approach for individualizing treatment for patients in different disease categories.},

This oncoprotein expresses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that is crucial for its cellular transforming activity. In this study, we evaluated the antineoplastic activity of {CGP}57148B, which is a competitive inhibitor of the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase. {METHODS}: Nude mice were given an injection of the Bcr/Abl-positive human leukemia cell lines {KU}812 or {MC}3. Tumor-bearing mice were treated intraperitoneally or orally with {CGP}57148B according to three different schedules. In vitro drug wash-out experiments and in vivo molecular pharmacokinetic experiments were performed to optimize the in vivo treatment schedule. {RESULTS}: Treatment schedules administering {CGP}57148B once or twice per day produced some inhibition of tumor growth, but no tumor-bearing mouse was cured. A single administration of {CGP}57148B caused substantial ({\textgreater}50\%) but short-lived (2-5 hours) inhibition of Bcr/Abl kinase activity. On the basis of the results from in vitro wash-out experiments, 20-21 hours was defined as the duration of continuous exposure needed to block cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis in these two leukemia cell lines. A treatment regimen assuring the continuous block of the Bcr/Abl phosphorylating activity that was administered over an 11-day period cured 87\%-100\% of treated mice. {CONCLUSION}: These data indicate that the continuous block of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase of Bcr/Abl protein is needed to produce important biologic effects in vivo.},

These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. Methods and Findings We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either {PLoS} Medicine or {PLoS} Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of {PLoS}'s explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. Conclusions We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

This chimeric {BCR}/{ABL} molecule transforms primary myeloid cells to leukemic cells and induces a {CML}-like disease in mice. The mouse {CML} model expressing the {BCR}/{ABL} molecule has provided important new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of {CML} and has directly answered many questions regarding this disease. Furthermore, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between leukemic clinical features and the position of the breakpoint in the {BCR} gene of the chimeric {BCR}/{ABL} gene. Understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of {CML} has led to the development of several novel therapies. The {BCR}/{ABL} molecule is unique oncogeneiety, having {ABL} tyrosine kinase activity, making it an ideal target for drug development. Subsequent clinical studies now realize the hypothesis that selective inhibition of the abl tyrosine kinase activity using imatinib mesylate might be useful for the treatment of {CML}.

This therapy has changed management strategies for treatment of patients with the diagnosis of {CML}.lmpilcatlons for {PracticeLong}-term observations and evaluations are needed for final determination of treatment effectiveness; thus, primary care providers will follow patients with {CML} in the community. Unforeseen toxicity may surface, requiring accurate assessment and evaluation. Primary care providers will be actively involved with providing symptom management for these patients.{SUMMARYA} new compound has been developed that targets the diseased cells in {CML} and appears to spare normal cells (Savage \& Antman, 2002). This selective-targeted therapy has the ability to inhibit the {BCR}-{ABL} tyrosine kinase enzyme, resulting in complete hemato-logic responses in 95\% and major cytogenetic responses in 60\% of the study subject patients with {CML} after a median follow-up of 18 months (see Table 1; Kantarjian et al., 2002).It is not yet known whether this new agent will kill the progenitor bone marrow stem cells that originally carry the Ph+ chromosome. Although a number of study subject patients obtained a complete remission, it is too early to determine whether the patients will ever be able to completely discontinue treatment. Patients may need to take the drug for the rest of their lives. A life-long commitment to a pill may be inconvenient, but the minimal side effects and lack of severe toxicities seen present a feasible option of treatment. Even though imatinib mesylate holds promise for the treatment of {CML}, several unanswered question remain: What is the optimal dose and length of therapy? How durable is the response? What are the late side effects or cumulative toxicities? When should patients use it, and should they use it alone or in combination with another agent. The final question remains: Can {CML} be cured with molecular-targeted therapy? All of these questions require further research. A randomized trial comparing imatinib mesylate to an interfer-on-based regimen in patients with newly diagnosed {CML} is ongoing, with early data suggesting the superiority of imatinib rnesylate to interferon therapy (Cortes et al., 2002).},

  abstract = {Conceptual and logistical challenges associated with the design and analysis of ecological restoration experiments are often viewed as being insurmountable, thereby limiting the potential value of restoration experiments as tests of ecological theory. Such research constraints are, however, not unique within the environmental sciences. Numerous natural and anthropogenic disturbances represent unplanned, uncontrollable events that cannot be replicated or studied using traditional experimental approaches and statistical analyses. A broad mix of appropriate research approaches (e.g., long-term studies, large-scale comparative studies, space-for-time substitution, modeling, and focused experimentation) and analytical tools (e.g., observational, spatial, and temporal statistics) are available and required to advance restoration ecology as a scientific discipline. In this article, research design and analytical options are described and assessed in relation to their applicability to restoration ecology. Significant research benefits may be derived from explicitly defining conceptual models and presuppositions, developing multiple working hypotheses, and developing and archiving high-quality data and metadata. Flexibility in research approaches and statistical analyses, high-quality databases, and new sampling approaches that support research at broader spatial and temporal scales are critical for enhancing ecological understanding and supporting further development of restoration ecology as a scientific discipline.},

  abstract = {{STI}571, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, has been a successful therapeutic agent in clinical trials for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with {STI}571 have durable responses; however, most responding blast phase patients relapse despite continued therapy. Co-crystallization studies of Abl kinase and an {STI}571-related compound identify specific amino acid residues as critical to {STI}571 binding, one of which, T315, has been characterized as an acquired Thr to Ile mutation in relapsed patients. Other studies, however, suggest that mutations other than these predicted contact points are capable of conferring {STI}571 resistance in relapsed patients. Using a variety of models of {STI}571 binding to the Abl kinase, we have performed an extensive mutational analysis of sites that might alter the sensitivity of the Abl kinase to {STI}571. Although mutation of many of the predicted contact points between Abl and {STI}571 result in a kinase-inactive protein, additional mutations that render the Abl kinase less sensitive to {STI}571 demonstrate a broad range of possibilities for clinical resistance that are now becoming evident.},

  abstract = {Issue Title: Including {PIH} Articles on Role of Monoclonal Antibodies for the Prevention and Treatment of Graft-Versus-Host Disease The correlation between imatinib ({IM}) trough plasma concentration (Cmin) and clinical response was assessed in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. The Cmin correlated with neither the achievement of complete cytogenetic response (977 vs. 993 ng/ml, P = 0.48) nor a major molecular response (1,044 vs. 818 ng/ml, P = 0.17). Although this was significantly higher in patients with complete molecular response ({CMR}) than in those without (1,430 vs. 859 ng/ml, P = 0.04), the difference was not significant in the sub-population treated with a standard dose of {IM} (400 mg/day). Finally, multivariate analysis showed that the {IM} standard dose, but not Cmin, was predictive of the achievement of {CMR}. We thus suggest that, in practical clinics at least, adherence to the standard dose is the most important factor for the achievement of {CMR}.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

  abstract = {The data underlying scientific papers should be accessible to researchers both now and in the future, but how best can we ensure that these data are available? Here we examine the effectiveness of four approaches to data archiving: no stated archiving policy, recommending (but not requiring) archiving, and two versions of mandating data deposition at acceptance. We control for differences between data types by trying to obtain data from papers that use a single, widespread population genetic analysis, structure. At one extreme, we found that mandated data archiving policies that require the inclusion of a data availability statement in the manuscript improve the odds of finding the data online almost 1000-fold compared to having no policy. However, archiving rates at journals with less stringent policies were only very slightly higher than those with no policy at all. We also assessed the effectiveness of asking for data directly from authors and obtained over half of the requested datasets, albeit with ∼8 d delay and some disagreement with authors. Given the long-term benefits of data accessibility to the academic community, we believe that journal-based mandatory data archiving policies and mandatory data availability statements should be more widely adopted.—Vines, T.
