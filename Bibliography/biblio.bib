	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently primary scientific data, especially that dealing with biodiversity, is neither easily discoverable nor accessible. Amongst several impediments, one is a lack of professional recognition of scientific data publishing efforts. A possible solution is establishment of a 'Data Publishing Framework' which would encourage and recognise investments and efforts by institutions and individuals towards management, and publishing of primary scientific data potentially on a par with recognitions received for scholarly publications. DISCUSSION: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of primary biodiversity data publishing, and conceptualises a 'Data Publishing Framework' that would help incentivise efforts and investments by institutions and individuals in facilitating free and open access to biodiversity data. It further postulates the institutionalisation of a 'Data Usage Index (DUI)', that would attribute due recognition to multiple players in the data collection/creation, management and publishing cycle. CONCLUSION: We believe that institutionalisation of such a 'Data Publishing Framework' that offers socio-cultural, legal, technical, economic and policy environment conducive for data publishing will facilitate expedited discovery and mobilisation of an exponential increase in quantity of 'fit-for-use' primary biodiversity data, much of which is currently invisible.},

	abstract = {Science research is increasingly computer and network enabled and referred to as e-science. The change has had an impact on the information environment in which scientists across disciplines operate to conduct their research. This paper reports on an NSF-funded project at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies (2007-2009) that examined this changing environment and directed specific attention to digital data management practices. A local faculty survey of data management practices and attitudes was conducted, as was a scan of related courses at peer institutions. Knowledge about data management in e-science was used to design a new course addressing data-related literacy for science students and teach them skills for managing data created as part of the scientific research process. Throughout the project, metadata proved to have a central role in how scientists operate in the e-science information environment and to be a key component of data literacy in the e-science environment.
